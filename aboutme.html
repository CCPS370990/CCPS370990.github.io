    <p>  I want to become  like my sister, my father, and my mother. I want my sister's smarts  she is good at math, I want to become a hardworking and easygoing-person. And  I would want my boss to say "Kai is   such a nice worker with integrity and passion for his job." and my traits are Physical: Weak Mental: Strong Emotional: Weak Spiritual: Christian and my skills  and ability  use to be drawing, last year I was pretty good at it.  Me and my friend Armani would use to draw together all the time and i thought even in highschool we would still draw but we went to different schools and i stopped drawing. My goals are  to get back into drawing  and get a decent job with a nice work enviorment and be able to get full wage.</p>
